## RGB Guessing Game
This is a web application that I made with javascript, specifically jQuery. Each new iteration of the game displays a random RGB value at the top of the screen. The user is tasked with clicking the square that corresponds with the current RGB value being shown.

## Technologies
- Javascript
- jQuery
- HTML/CSS

## Future Versions
- Add a third difficulty level that uses 9 squares instead of 6
- Try converting app to React.js or Vue.js
